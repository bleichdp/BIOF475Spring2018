My biggest pain point right now is that I don't think that the original project idea that I proposed
(about what categories of books people are most interested in) will work. At the time, I did not realize
how we should get the data and thought that somehow I could get the data off of web page screens. 
So, I need to come up with an alternate idea, for which I can obtain a large set of data. I have some ideas;
I am particularly interested in environmental data, but I have to narrow it down.
